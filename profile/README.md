### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **LiteTools focuses on making lightweight and open source tools for computers.**

# What We Do
We develop quality software that both experienced and inexperienced computer users can use with ease. Our softwares are based around apps that can be used on a daily basis. 

## Our Goal
We believe that applications should not include paywalls that prevent users from using features that are advertised, all features we list will stay free forever.  We also believe that applications should be open-sourced so anyone can help, view, and collaborate on our code.

## Products
We have multiple departments of software. Our LiteTools software is completely free and open source while Cubicle is a paid software suite.

### LiteTools Software
We develop lightweight and free software for anyone to install, we try our best to ensure an easy experience better than other applications. We update our apps actively for security and safety. Everyone can contribute, since our projects are open-sourced and these applications are free of charge with no hidden payments.
