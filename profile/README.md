# What We Do
We develop quality software that both experienced and inexperienced computer users can use with ease. Our softwares are based around apps that can be used on a daily basis. 

## Our Goal
We believe that applications should not include paywalls that prevent users from using features that are advertised, all features we list will stay free forever.  We also believe that applications should be open-sourced so anyone can help, view, and collaborate on our code.
